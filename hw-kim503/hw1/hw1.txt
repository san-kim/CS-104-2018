Problem 6
Part 1
#3: The storage manager is problematic because parts of the buffer can be 
overwritten via the clearing method of the free_chars() function. The function 
"frees" or sets to '\0' all elements of buffer after the specified 
index-pointer, which allows for the memory to be re-allocated by the 
alloc_chars() function now that it is now effectively "empty". The user 
may still have buffer pointers to members of buffer that were after the 
"freed" index-pointer that may have been deleted & lost by the usage of the 
free-chars() function. Since the memory can be reallocated (since it is now 
empty), it can be overwritten when a new incoming input requests allocated 
space and is assigned the space that the previously-held pointer resided on, 
changing the value of where the user's pointer points to.
